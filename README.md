## :thinking: What is it?

This is a simple function that returns a file with the computed CSS added to an element with ids or classes. \
\
In some cases, existing solutions were not enough and I was trying to have some fun creating something different. \
\
You just have to point some url, the id, or class of an element. \
\
You will get a CSS file with the custom CSS added to this element. \
\
***Obs:*** *If you're using this, would you be kind to tell me how useful it is to you?*

## :rocket: Quick start

### Step 1: Clone The Repo

Fork the repository, then clone the repo locally by doing -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bobarros/customcss-to-file
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

cd into the directory

```bash
cd customcss-to-file
```

install all the dependencies
```bash
yarn install
or
npm install
```

### Step 3: Editing variables or not

I'm using Google's website as a placeholder if you just want to test. \
Replace with your target on getCSS.js, if you will.
```
const targetUrl = "https://www.google.com/";
const targetElement = "k1zIA"; //id or classname
```

Now, jus execute it:

```
yarn start
or maybe
node getCSS.js
```
